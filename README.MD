# Spotify-label-mod

Spotify-label-mod is a very simple GNOME Shell extension that displays current track information in the system tray using Spotify's dbus interface without using the web API. There are no playback controls and/or album art display, and there never will be. This is intended to be nothing more than a simple label for Spotify only. 

## The True Change

Added Spotify app icon, to make beautify and make sense from origin

## Features

- Shows the title, artist and album information, and allows you to customize how it's shown. Can set separate display formats for podcasts and songs.

- Can choose which part of the top panel it will live in

- Uses Spotify's exposed dbus interface to fetch metadata, doesn't use the web API or require a premium account

- Works on Wayland as well as X

## Installation 


1. Clone this repo anywhere on your computer

2. Run the install script with `./<path_to_dir>/install.sh`. By default the files are copied into a new directory under `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`.

2. Restart gnome-shell (xorg) and activate the extension via gnome-tweaks. Gnome-shell cannot be restarted under Wayland, so you may have to log out and back in.

## Dependencies 

* `libgtop` and gnome-tweaks as usual to load/install GNOME shell extensions.

## Notes

I haven't tested it with any shell version older than 3.36 because I can't be bothered. If you have tested it and can confirm that it works, let me know.
